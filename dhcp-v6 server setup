Understanding ipv6

An Ipv6 address uses 128 bits as opposed to 32 bits in IPv4.
IPv6 addresses are written using hexadecimal, as opposed to dotted decimal in IPv4. 
Because an hexadecimal number uses 4 bits this means that an IPv6 address consists of 32 hexadecimal numbers.
These numbers are grouped in 4’s giving 8 groups or blocks. The groups are written with a : (colon) as a separator.

group1:group2: ……etc…. :group8

Here is an IPv6 address example:
  2001:0(0000 shortened to 0):9d38:6ab8:1c48:3a1c:a95a:b1c2

Network And Node Addresses
  In IPv4 an address is split into two components a network component and a node component.
  This was done initially using Address classes and later using subnet masking.
  In IPv6 we do the same. The first step is to split the address into two parts.
  The address is split into 2 64 bit segments the left 64 bits is the network part and the right 64 bits the node part:
